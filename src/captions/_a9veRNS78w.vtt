00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.800
We're getting ready to move on
from the topic of functions.

2
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.233
But before we do, let's just make sure
that you're familiar with these

3
00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:13.633
very useful functions that you will see
throughout your mathematical study.

4
00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.066
So I want to talk to you first
about the floor and ceiling functions.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.633
Again, I am quite certain

6
00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:22.266
you've probably seen this before, but
if not, they're pretty straightforward.

7
00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:26.633
The floor function
essentially tells us to round down

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.833
to the largest integer
less than or equal to x.

9
00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:31.300
And it's easy to remember

10
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.166
this is the floor function because
our brackets essentially have a floor.

11
00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:39.566
And the ceiling function is similar
but asks us to round up

12
00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.433
to the nearest integer greater
than or equal to x.

13
00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.800
So let's take a look at an example.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.366
I've got 2.2, and if I'm thinking
about 2.2 on a number line,

15
00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:53.500
then I'm thinking about

16
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.066
2, and then 3, and 2.2

17
00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.533
is right around somewhere in there.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.800
And if I'm rounding or
if I'm using the ceiling function,

19
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:10.200
the ceiling function says
round up to the next integer

20
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:14.000
and the floor function says round

21
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.833
down to the next integer.

22
00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.633
Same thing happens for my -3.7.

23
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.033
But just be careful how
you put these numbers on the number line.

24
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.500
Remember, 0 is over here somewhere.

25
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.733
This would be -3,

26
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:33.866
this would be -4, and -3.7 somewhere in here.

27
00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:36.700
And then if I'm rounding up

28
00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:40.166
for my ceiling function,
I end up at -3.

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.533
If I'm rounding down to my floor function,
I end up at -4.

30
00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.633
So just be very careful
with your negatives.

31
00:01:48.966 --> 00:01:50.166
And I am certain,

32
00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.300
absolutely certain that you have
had the factorial function before.

33
00:01:53.766 --> 00:01:58.400
Factorial function
is essentially denoted by f(n) = n!

34
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.400
That's the exclamation point,
which means factorial.

35
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.866
And it is the product of the first
n positive integers

36
00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.233
when n is a non-negative integer.

37
00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:12.633
So I give you an f(n) here

38
00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.200
but let's say f(4).

39
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.033
I would take
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

40
00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:22.366
That would be my factorial function.

41
00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:24.300
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

42
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.700
So again,
symbolically, it's n, n - 1,

43
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.600
n - 2, all the way down
until you get to 1.

44
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.266
Stirling's formula is fantastic.

45
00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:39.366
We're not going to use it a ton right now,
but this is a way

46
00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:44.100
because that factorial function
gets very large very quickly.

47
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.100
This is an approximation that we can find

48
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400
of the product of the numbers

49
00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.966
of n!.

50
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.100
Here's just one more
example for you to try.

51
00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:03.500
Our function is the floor function
of x squared divided by two and we're

52
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.800
trying to find f(S) for the set of S,

53
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.500
which includes 0, 1, 2, and 3.

54
00:03:10.833 --> 00:03:13.466
So if you'd like, go ahead and press pause
and try it yourself

55
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.400
before I go through the answer.

56
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000
Otherwise, we're going to get started.

57
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So if I'm finding f(0),

58
00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:26.333
that tells me 0 squared
divided by 2 and the floor

59
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:30.333
function of that 0 squared is 0
divided by 2 is 0.

60
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.533
And the floor of 0 would
of course be 0.

61
00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:36.800
If I'm looking at f(1),

62
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.900
f(1) would be 1

63
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.300
squared over 2 and the floor function

64
00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.566
1 squared is 1.

65
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.466
1 divided by 2,
that just gives me one half.

66
00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:52.766
So what is the floor function of one half?

67
00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:57.000
That is also 0.

68
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.633
Let's do f(2).

69
00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.800
f(2) is the floor function
of 2 squared

70
00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:05.500
over 2.

71
00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:10.000
Oops, floor function
of 2 squared over 2.

72
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.500
Which is...
2 squared is 4, divided by 2

73
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.300
And the floor function of 2
of course gives me 2.

74
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:21.733
And my last one, f(3)

75
00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:26.800
tells me the floor of 3
squared over 2,

76
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.766
which is the floor of 9 over 2.

77
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.800
And the floor of 9 over 2,
which is basically

78
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.733
4.5 is 4.

79
00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:40.933
So these would
be my solutions: 0, 0, 2, 4.

80
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.366
Up next,

81
00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:47.166
we are going to switch gears
and talk a little bit about sequences.

82
00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.666
So it's an introduction to sequences.
